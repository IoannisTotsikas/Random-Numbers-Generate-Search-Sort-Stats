# Random Number Array Generator and Analyzer

This is a simple C program I wrote to practice working with arrays and basic programming concepts. It creates a list of random numbers and lets you:
- Pick how many numbers you want (from 20 to 100)  
- See the random numbers printed nicely  
- Find the total, average, biggest, and smallest number  
- Look for a number you choose inside the list  
- Sort all the numbers from smallest to biggest  
- Run the program again if you want to try with new numbers
